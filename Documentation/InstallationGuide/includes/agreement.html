Memberships, and Products   available for  individual sale, are sold as a one-person one-domain   license unless  otherwise stated and are not transferable to another   user at any time  as stated. Therefore, any business, association,   enterprise,  corporation, company, or the like employing more than one   individual  that is not otherwise involved with the day-to-day running   of the business would require a new license.

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
